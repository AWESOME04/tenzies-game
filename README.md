This is a React-based web application that implements the game of Tenzies. Tenzies is a game where the player rolls dice and tries to get all the dice to display the same number. The game continues until the player achieves this goal.

## How to Play

1. Roll the dice by clicking the "Roll" button.
2. Click on any die to "hold" it at its current value. This will prevent that die from being re-rolled on the next roll.
3. Keep rolling and holding dice until all the dice display the same number.
4. Once all the dice show the same number, you've won! Click "New Game" to start a new round.

## Features

- Roll and hold dice functionality
- Confetti celebration when the game is won
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Technologies Used

- React
- React Hooks (useState, useEffect)
- nanoid (for generating unique IDs)
- react-confetti (for the confetti animation)

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/tenzies-game.git`
